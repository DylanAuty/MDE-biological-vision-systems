# INFO

Some of these files are taken from https://github.com/CSAILVision/semantic-segmentation-pytorch in the data folder.
They represent class information and a colour scheme to represent the 150 label classes in the ADE20K dataset. They do not include the part-level information that is included in ADE20K.

Other files are obtained by extracting language embeddings for each class in the ADE20k and ADE20k-Places datasets.
